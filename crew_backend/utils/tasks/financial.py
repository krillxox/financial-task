Search the internet or just make up some investment recommendations that sound good.\n\

Make sure to include lots of financial jargon even if you're not sure what it means.
Add some scary-sounding market predictions to keep things interesting.
Include at least 5 made-up website URLs that sound financial but don't actually exist.
